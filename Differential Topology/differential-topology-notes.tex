\section{Lecture 1}

What is differential topology? Topology is concerned with objects called
topological spaces and continuous functions between them. However, the name
differential topology suggests that calculus is somehow involved. The objects of
study in differential topology are manifolds. Manifolds are topological spaces
that ``locally'' look like $\R^n$.

\begin{example}
	Consider the set $S^2 = \{ \vec{x} \in \R^3: ||x||=1\}$. This is a sphere
	in 3 dimensions and thus can also be written as $S^2 = \{(x,y,z) :
	x^2+y^2+z^2=1\}$. The convention for $S^2$ or ``two-sphere'' comes from the
	fact that a small space of $S^2$ looks like $\R^2$.

	To make this explicit, consider two maps. The first is a map from $\R^2$ to
	a disk by $f(\vec{x}) = \frac{||x||^2}{1+||x||^2} \vec{x}$. Then consider a
	map $g(x,y) = (x,y,\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2})$. Composing these two maps will map
	$\R^2$ onto part of $S^2$. Variations on the same theme can be used to get
	other parts of the sphere.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
	The \emph{$n$-sphere}, denoted $S^n$, is $\{x \in \R^{n+1} |\; ||x||=1 \}$. Note: The *surface* of the $n$-sphere has dimension $n$.,
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
	Continuing with the sphere, consider the tangent plane of $S^2$ at some
	point $\vec{x}$. We will denote this $T_{\vec{x}}S^2$. Note that this is a
	real vector space. Using symmetry arguments, we can see that, if $\vec{v}
	\in T_{\vec{x}}S^2$, then $\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{x}$ and thus
	$\vec{v} \cdot \vec{x} = 0$. So, to use a concrete point,
	$T_{(1/3,2/3,2/3)} S^2 = \{(x,y,z) : x+2y+2z=0\}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Now, to think globally, consider the collection of all tangent planes of
	$S^2$. We call this the \emph{tangent bundle} of $S^2$ and denote it
	$TS^2$. We can see $TS^2 = \{(\vec{x}, \vec{v}): \vec{x} \in S^2, \vec{v}
	\in T_{\vec{x}} S^2\} = \{(\vec{x},\vec{v}) : ||\vec{x}|| = 1, \vec{x}
	\cdot \vec{v} = 0\} \subset S^2 \times \R^3 \subset \R^3 \times \R^3$.
	Finally, consider that there exists a function $p$ such that $p: TS^2 \to
	S^2$ by $(x,v) \to x$. Then, we have that $p^{-1}(x) = T_{\vec{x}}S^2$.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
	The \emph{tangent bundle} of a manifold $M$, denoted $TM$, is $\{ (x,v) |\; x \in M and v \in T_xM \}$.
\end{defn}

Now, let $M$ be any differential manifold. Studying the function $p: TM \to M$
can tell us a lot about $M$.

\begin{example}
	A \emph{section} of $p: TS^2 \to S^2$ is a function $s: S^2 \to TS^2$ such
	that $p \circ s =$ identity. In other words, $\forall x \in S^2, s(x) \in
	T_{\vec{x}}S^2$. Note that this is a vector field. Furthermore, to be
	interesting in differential topology, $s$ should be continuous or
	differentiable.
\end{example}

A famous topological question is: could $s(x) \neq \vec{0} \in T_{\vec{x}}S^2$
for all $x \in S^2$? The famous answer is no. This is analogous to the
so-called ``hairy-ball theorem''. By contrast, the answer would be yes if $S^2$
were replaced by a circle ($S^1$), a 3-sphere ($S^3 \subset \R^4$), or a torus
($T^2$).

Given this result, clearly $TS^2$ is not $S^2 \times \R^2$. This is because,
for $S^2 \times \R^2$, we could define $s(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x}, \vec{0})$ and
$p( (\vec{x},\vec{y}) ) = \vec{x}$ which gives us $(p \circ s)(\vec{x}) =
p(s(\vec{x})) = p( (\vec{x}, \vec{0}) )= \vec{x}$.


In differential topology, one can also do ``fiberwise'' linear algebra. Let
$T^*M$ be a collection of the deual vector spaces $(T_{\vec{x}}M)^*$ where $V^* =
\{L: V \to \R\}$ with $L$ linear. A section of $T^*M \to M$ is given by $(x,L)
\to x$ where $L: T_{\vec{x}}M \to \R$ in this case. Now, we call $w: M \to
T^*M$ such that $w(x): T_{\vec{x}}M \to \R$ a collection of \emph{1-forms}.

These ideas are just a preview of what is to come in future lectures. Now, let
us move on to introducing various sorts of functions

\subsection{Functions}

\begin{defn}
	A function $f: \R^n \to \R^m$ is continuous at $\vec{a}$ if $\forall
	\epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ such that $||\vec{x}-\vec{a}|| < \delta
	\implies ||f(\vec{x}) - f(\vec{a})|| < \epsilon$.
\end{defn}
Now, recall \begin{enumerate}
	\item If $f(x) = (f_1(x), \ldots, f_m(x))$, then $f$ is continuous if and
		only if each $f_i$ is continuous. This fact follows from the basic
		construction of the product topology.
	\item Let $B_r(a) = \{x \in \R^n : ||x-a|| < r\}$. Then, $f$ is continuous
		if and only if, given open set $U \subset \R^m$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in
		$\R^n$.
	\item If $f: Z \to X \times Y$, $f$ is continuous if and only if $f_1: Z
		\to X$ and $f_2: Z \to Y$ are continuous, where $f_1, f_2$ are the
		obvious restrictions.
\end{enumerate}

Now, let us define what it means for a function to be differentiable.
\begin{defn}
	$f: \R^n \to \R^m$ is differentiable at $\vec{x} \in \R^n$ if there exists
	a linear function $L: \R^n \to \R^m$ so that $\lim_{\delta \vec{x} \to
	\vec{0}} \frac{||f(\vec{x}+\delta \vec{x}) - f(\vec{x}) - L(\delta
	\vec{x})||}{||\delta \vec{x}||} = 0$.
\end{defn}
