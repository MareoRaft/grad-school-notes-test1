What is differential topology? Topology is concerned with objects called
topological spaces and continuous functions between them. However, the name
differential topology suggests that calculus is somehow involved. The objects of
study in differential topology are manifolds. Manifolds are topological spaces
that ``locally'' look like $\R^n$.

\begin{example}
	Consider the set $S^2 = \{ \vec{x} \in \R^3: ||x||=1\}$. This is a sphere
	in 3 dimensions and thus can also be written as $S^2 = \{(x,y,z) :
	x^2+y^2+z^2=1\}$. The convention for $S^2$ or ``two-sphere'' comes from the
	fact that a small space of $S^2$ looks like $\R^2$.

	To make this explicit, consider two maps. The first is a map from $\R^2$ to
	a disk by $f(\vec{x}) = \frac{||x||^2}{1+||x||^2} \vec{x}$. Then consider a
	map $g(x,y) = (x,y,\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2})$. Composing these two maps will map
	$\R^2$ onto part of $S^2$. Variations on the same theme can be used to get
	other parts of the sphere.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
	The \emph{$n$-sphere}, denoted $S^n$, is $\{x \in \R^{n+1} |\; ||x||=1 \}$. Note: The *surface* of the $n$-sphere has dimension $n$.,
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
	Continuing with the sphere, consider the plane through the origin that is parallel to the tangent plane of $S^2$ at some
	point $\vec{x}$. We will denote this $T_{\vec{x}}S^2$. Note that this is a
	real vector space. Using symmetry arguments, we can see that, if $\vec{v}
	\in T_{\vec{x}}S^2$, then $\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{x}$ and thus
	$\vec{v} \cdot \vec{x} = 0$. So, to use a concrete point,
	$T_{(1/3,2/3,2/3)} S^2 = \{(x,y,z) : x+2y+2z=0\}$.  Note also that we will abusively call this plane the \emph{tangent plane}, even though we are actually referring to the plane through $0$ instead of the plane through $\vec{x}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Now, to think globally, consider the collection of all tangent planes of
	$S^2$. We call this the \emph{tangent bundle} of $S^2$ and denote it
	$TS^2$. We can see $TS^2 = \{(\vec{x}, \vec{v}): \vec{x} \in S^2, \vec{v}
	\in T_{\vec{x}} S^2\} = \{(\vec{x},\vec{v}) : ||\vec{x}|| = 1, \vec{x}
	\cdot \vec{v} = 0\} \subset S^2 \times \R^3 \subset \R^3 \times \R^3$.
	Finally, consider that there exists a function $p$ such that $p: TS^2 \to
	S^2$ by $(x,v) \to x$. Then, we have that $p^{-1}(x) = T_{\vec{x}}S^2$.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
	The \emph{tangent bundle} of a manifold $M$, denoted $TM$, is $\{ (x,v) |\; x \in M \;\text{and}\; v \in T_xM \}$.
\end{defn}

Now, let $M$ be any differential manifold. Studying the function $p: TM \to M$
can tell us a lot about $M$.

\begin{example}
	A \emph{section} of $p: TS^2 \to S^2$ is a function $s: S^2 \to TS^2$ such
	that $p \circ s =$ identity. In other words, $\forall x \in S^2, s(x) \in
	T_{\vec{x}}S^2$. Note that this is a vector field. Furthermore, to be
	interesting in differential topology, $s$ should be continuous or
	differentiable.
\end{example}



\subsection{Functions}

\begin{defn}
	A function $f: \R^n \to \R^m$ is continuous at $\vec{a}$ if $\forall
	\epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ such that $||\vec{x}-\vec{a}|| < \delta
	\implies ||f(\vec{x}) - f(\vec{a})|| < \epsilon$.
\end{defn}
Now, recall \begin{enumerate}
	\item If $f(x) = (f_1(x), \ldots, f_m(x))$, then $f$ is continuous if and
		only if each $f_i$ is continuous. This fact follows from the basic
		construction of the product topology.
	\item Let $B_r(a) = \{x \in \R^n : ||x-a|| < r\}$. Then, $f$ is continuous
		if and only if, given open set $U \subset \R^m$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in
		$\R^n$.
	\item If $f: Z \to X \times Y$, $f$ is continuous if and only if $f_1: Z
		\to X$ and $f_2: Z \to Y$ are continuous, where $f_1, f_2$ are the
		obvious restrictions.
\end{enumerate}

Now, let us define what it means for a function to be differentiable.
\begin{defn}
	$f :\R^n \to \R^m$ is \emph{differentiable} at $x \in R^n$ if there exists a linear function $df_x : \R^n \to \R^m$  such that $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|| (f(x)-f(x+h)) - (df_x(h)) ||}{||h||} = 0$.  Note that $h$ is a vector, as well as $x$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ by a linear function $L$, then $L$ is the \emph{differential} of $f$ at $x$.  This is denoted $df_x$.  Using the standard basis, the differential can be expressed as a slope matrix, which is denoted $f'(x)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	If $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then the differential $df_x$ in the $v$ direction is equal to $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x+tv) - f(x)}{t}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[a-b-dimensional tangent plane]
	Given a function $f : \R^a \to \R^b$ and its slope matrix $f^\prime(v)$ at a vector $v \in \R^a$, then the equation for any point $w$ on the plane tangent to $f$ at $v$ is $g_v(w) = f(v) + f'(v)(w-v)$ or, in point-slope form, $\frac{g_v(w)-f(v)}{w-v} = f'(v)$.
	% dependencies: [function, derivative, tangent],
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[billiard ball theorem]
	A continuously differentiable section $s$ on $TS^2$ with $s(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in S^2$ does not exist.,
	intuition: Can you draw a continuously differentiable, always nonzero vector field on a billiard ball?  No.,
	% // NO --> apparently TS^2 not isomorphic to S^2 \times \R^2.
	% // Ts^2 \subseteq S^2 \times \R^3 \subseteq \R^3 \times \R^3.
\end{thm}

A famous topological question is: could $s(x) \neq \vec{0} \in T_{\vec{x}}S^2$
for all $x \in S^2$? The famous answer is no. This is analogous to the
so-called ``hairy-ball theorem''. By contrast, the answer would be yes if $S^2$
were replaced by a circle ($S^1$), a 3-sphere ($S^3 \subset \R^4$), or a torus
($T^2$).

Given this result, clearly $TS^2$ is not $S^2 \times \R^2$. This is because,
for $S^2 \times \R^2$, we could define $s(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x}, \vec{0})$ and
$p( (\vec{x},\vec{y}) ) = \vec{x}$ which gives us $(p \circ s)(\vec{x}) =
p(s(\vec{x})) = p( (\vec{x}, \vec{0}) )= \vec{x}$.


In differential topology, one can also do ``fiberwise'' linear algebra. Let
$T^*M$ be a collection of the dual vector spaces $(T_{\vec{x}}M)^*$ where $V^* =
\{L: V \to \R\}$ with $L$ linear. A section of $T^*M \to M$ is given by $(x,L)
\to x$ where $L: T_{\vec{x}}M \to \R$ in this case. Now, we call $w: M \to
T^*M$ such that $w(x): T_{\vec{x}}M \to \R$ a collection of \emph{1-forms}.


\begin{defn}
	The set $U$ is \emph{open} if it can be written as a union of open balls $B$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	The set $U$ is open iff for all points in $U$, there exists an open ball around the point that's entirely contained in $U$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[continuity and openness]
	$f$ is continuous iff for every open set $U \in \R^m$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\R^n$.
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
	A \emph{topological space} (a.k.a \emph{space}) is a set $X$ and a set $O$ of subsets of $X$ that satisfy the following conditions.  Every element of $O$ is ``open'' by definition.  Further:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.
		\item Finite intersections of open sets are open.
		\item The empty set is open.
		\item The entire space is open.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	For any $k \in \N$, a function $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is \emph{$k$-continuously-differentiable}, denoted $f \in C^k$, if all iterated partial derivatives of $f$ of order $k$ exist and are continuous.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	For any $k \in \N$, the function $f$ has class $C^k$ iff all of its coordinate functions $f_i$ have class $C^k$.
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
	Given a set $V$, a \emph{distance} is a function $D : V \times V \to \R$ that satisfies, for all $x, y, z \in V$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $D(x,x) = 0$
		\item If $x \neq y$, then $D(x,y) > 0$
		\item (symmetry) $D(x,y) = D(y,x)$
		\item (triangle inequality) $D(x,z) <= D(x,y) + D(y,z)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	A \emph{metric space} is $(X, D)$ where $X$ is a set and $D$ is a distance function on $X$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[analytic functions]
	A function $f$ is \emph{analytic} if for every point $x$ in the domain, there exists a taylor series centered at $x$ which converges to $f$ in a neighborhood of $x$.  Note: The class of analytic functions is denoted $C^\omega$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	$C^\omega \subsetneq C^\infty \subsetneq \subsetneq \subsetneq C^n \subsetneq C^{n-1} \subsetneq \subsetneq \subsetneq C^0$
\end{thm}
\begin{example}
	The function $$f(x) =
	\begin{cases}
		e^{-1/x^2} &\text{if $x \neq 0$} \\
		0 &\text{if $x=0$} \\
	\end{cases}
	$$
	is in $C^\infty$, but it is NOT analytic.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
	$K \subseteq X$ is \emph{compact} in $X$ if whenever $K \subseteq \cup_{i \in I} O$ of open sets, then there exists $J$ finite subset of $I$ such that $K \subseteq union_{j \in J} O$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	If $K$ is compact in $X$ and $f:X \to Y$ is continuous, then $f(X)$ is compact in $Y$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	If $O$ is open (closed) in $Y$ and $f:X \to Y$ is continuous, then $f^{-1}(O)$ is open (closed) in $X$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	If $K$ is compact in $X$ and $C$ is closed in $X$, then $K \cap C$ is compact in $X$.
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
	A topological space $X$ is \emph{Hausdorff} if for every $a \neq b$ in $X$, there exists an open neighborhood $A$ of $a$ and an open neighborhood $B$ of $b$ such that $A \cap B = {}$.  Synonym: seperable.  Notation: $T_2$ is the set of all Hausdorff topological spaces.
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}
	If $X$ is Hausdorff and $K$ is compact in $X$, then $K$ is closed in $X$.
\end{lem}
\begin{defn}
	$f$ is an \emph{open} (\emph{closed}) function if the image of every open (closed) set under $f$ is open (closed).
\end{defn}
\begin{cor}
	If $f : X \to Y$ is continuous, $X$ is compact ((wait, is X a subset of Y??)), and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is a closed function.
\end{cor}
\begin{cor}
	If $f : X \to Y$ is a continuous bijection, and $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is a homeomorphism. (That is, $f^{-1}$ is continuous).
\end{cor}
\begin{thm}
	A compact top subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed. ((ermmmm))
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	If $X$ and $Y$ are compact, then $X \times Y$ is compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	$X$ is a top space and $~$ is an equivalence relation on $X$.  Then there is a topology on $X/~$ (the set of equivalence classes) as follows.  $S \subseteq X/~$ is open iff (let backwards(S) : X/~ to X) backwards(S) is open in X.  [[ f: X/~ to Y is continuous iff f of g : X to Y is contniuous.
\end{thm}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The function $m : G \times G \to G$ defined by $m((g,h)) = gh$ is continuous.
		\item The function $i : G \to G$ defined by $i(g) = g^{-1}$ is continuous.
	\end{enumerate}
	See Bredon I.15 for more related definitions.
\end{defn}












\begin{defn}[derivative of multivariable function]
	The \emph{tangent plane} to function $f : \R^n \to \R^m$ at point $a$, denoted $df_a$ or $f^{\prime}(a)$, is the unique function that satisfies $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{||f(a+h) - f(a) - df_a(h)||}{||h||} = 0$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	The \emph{directional derivative} of $f$ at $x$ in the $v$ direction is $df_x(v)$ which is $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+hv) - f(x)}{h}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	Let $U$ and $V$ be open sets in $\R^n$ (topological spaces, soon).  A function $f:U\to V$ is a \emph{homeomorphism} iff it is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.
	Synonym: bi-continuous function.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	Let $U$ and $V$ be open sets in $\R^n$.  A function $f:U\to V$ is a \emph{$C^r$-diffeomorphism} iff it is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are $r$-continuously-differentiable.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	Let $U$ and $V$ be open sets in $\R^n$.  A function $f:U\to V$ is a \emph{diffeomorphism} iff it is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are differentiable.
	Synonym: bi-differentiable function.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	A function $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is \emph{smooth}, denoted $C^\infty$ if $f$ is $C^k$ for all $k \in \N$.
	Synonym: $\infty$-continuous.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	If $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is $C^1$ in a neighborhood of $x$, then $f$ is differentiable at $x$.
	% // no proof :(
	% // need to understand this better
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	If $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is $C^2$ in a neighborhood of $x$, then for all $i$ and $j$, $\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x) = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}(x)$.
	% // no proof :(
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}[chain rule]
	If $f$ is differentiable at $a$ and $g$ is differentiable at $f(a)$, then $(g \circ f)$ is differentiable at $a$, and $(g \circ f)'(a) = g'(f(a))f'(a)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[inverse function theorem]
	For any $k \in \N^+$, if $f:\R^n \to \R^n$ is $C^k$ and $f^\prime(x)$ is invertible for some $x$, then $f$ is locally a diffeomorphism of class $C^k$ at $x$.
\end{thm}
\begin{example}
	Counterexample: Let $$f(x) =
	\begin{cases}
		\frac x2 + x^2\sin\left(\frac 1x\right) \text{ if $x \neq 0$} \\
		0 \text{ if $x=0$} \\
	\end{cases}
	$$  We see that $f$ is differentiable, but the derivative is not continuous (i haven't verified this).  It turns out that $f$ is not one-to-one (and therefore not a bijection).
\end{example}
\begin{thm}[local submersion theorem]
	Synonym: implicit function theorem.
	Note: This theorem is equivalent to the inverse function theorem.

	function $f : \R^{k+m} \to \R^m$ is $C^1$.
	Let $x \in \R^{k+m}$ and $z \in \R^m$.
	Suppose $f'(x)$ has rank $m$.
	Then there exists $W$ nbd $x$ and $V$ nbd $z$ and $U$ open in $\R^k$ and a diffeomorphism $I : W \to U \times V$
	s.t. $f = I.\pi$ where $\pi$ is the projection from $U \times V$ onto $V$.

\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[local immersion theorem]
	This is very similar to the local submersion theorem (more soon...)

	function $f : \R^{m} \to \R^{m+k}$ is $C^1$.
	Let $x \in \R^{m}$ and $z \in \R^{m+k}$.
	Suppose $f'(x)$ has rank $m$.
	Then there exists $V$ nbd $x$ and $W$ nbd $z$ and $U$ open in $\R^k$ and a diffeomorphism $I : U \times V \to W$
	s.t. $f = in.I$ where $in$ is the inclusion from $V$ to $U \times V$.

\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	If $f$ is locally diffeomorphic at $x$, then the slope matrix of $f^{-1}$ at $f(x)$ is given by $(f^{-1})^\prime(f(x)) = (f^\prime(a))^{-1}$.
	Proof. $f$ is locally diffeomorphic at $x$, so $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.
	Apply the chain rule: $(f^{-1})^\prime(f(x)) \cdot f^\prime(x) = 1$.
	Finally: $(f^{-1})^\prime(f(x)) = (f^\prime(x))^{-1}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
	A function $f : \R^a \to \R^b$ is continuous iff each of its coordinate functions $f_i$, $1<= i <=b$, are continuous.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	$X$ is \emph{connected} if whenever $X = A \cup B$ ($A$ and $B$ are both open and nonempty), then $A \cap B$ is nonempty.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A top space $M$ is \emph{second countable} if there exists a countable basis of $M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A space $M$ is an $n$-dim top \emph{manifold} if $M$ is seperable and 2nd-countable, and $M$ has an open cover $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ such that each $U_i$ is homeomorphic (via $phi_i$) to an open set in $\R^n$.  Then $\{ U_i, \phi_i \}$ is called an \emph{atlas} for $M$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	The union of any amount of atlases is itself an atlas.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	An atlas for $M$ is \emph{smooth} if every $phi_\beta$ of $phi_\alpha^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$ both ways.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Two smooth atlases $A$ and $A^\prime$ are \emph{equivalent} if for each $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\phi_\beta^\prime$ of $\phi_\alpha^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$ both ways.
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
	It can be verified that the above definition really is an equivalence relation.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{smooth} manifold is just a manifold coupled with an equivalence class of smooth atlases.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
	closed manifold implies compact manifold.  i think.
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}
	There exist 4-dim manifolds that can't be smooth.
\end{thm}



\begin{example}
	$M = \R$ and $A = \{ id: \R \to \R \}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	$M = S^1$.  $A = {U_l, U_r, U_t, U_b}$.  For $U_t$, for example, we choose $phi_t$ to be a projection of the semicircle with open endpoints to a line segment with open endpoints.  Do the same for the others.  Looking at $\phi^{-1}$ of $\phi$'s will reveal that their composition is $C^\infty$, so we conclude that $A$ is smooth.
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
	An \emph{n-}manifold or \emph{n-dimensional} manifold is a manifold that is locally homeomorphic to $\R^n$.  ("n-" is the adjective to "manifold".)
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	Given $M$ smooth manifold w/ atlas $A = \{ U_a, \,  \phi_a : U_a \to \R^m \}$.
	Given $N$ smooth manifold w/ atlas $B = \{ O_b, \,  \phi_b : U_b \to \R^n \}$.
	A cont function $f : M \to N$ is \emph{smooth} if for all $a$, for all $b$, $\phi_a^{-1}.f.\psi_b$ is smooth.  You might call $f$ a \emph{mersion}.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	Given the same givens as above.
	$N$ and $M$ are \emph{diffeomorphic} if there exists $f : M \to N$ and $g : N \to M$ both smooth such that $f.g = id_M$ and $g.f = id_N$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Matt's version]
	$N$ and $M$ are \emph{diffeomorphic} if they are bimersive.  (That is, there exists a bimersion between them.)
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
	Some manifolds have NO smooth atlases.

	Some manifolds have 2 (or more) smooth atlases that are not equivalent to each other.
\end{rmk}


\begin{thm}
	$\R^4$ has an uncountable number of smooth structures (equivalence classes of smooth atlases).  (But all other $\R^n$ have a unique smooth structure.)
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
	If $(M,A)$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, and $U$ an open set in $M$, then $(U,A_U)$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, where $A_U$ is like $A$, but intersecting each set with $U$, and restricting the $\phi$ functions accordingly.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
	Given $M$ smooth $m$-manifold with atlas $A = \{ U_a, \,\phi_a : U_a \to \R^m \}$.
	Given $N$ smooth $n$-manifold with atlas $B = \{ V_b, \,\psi_b : V_b \to \R^n \}$.
	$m <=n$.
	A smooth function $f : M \to N$  is an \emph{immersion} if given any $a, b$ such that $\phi_a: U_a \to \R^m$, $\psi_b: V_b \to \R^n$, and any $x \in \phi_a(U_a \cap V_b.f^{-1})$, then $x.(\phi_a^{-1}.f.\psi_b)'$ has rank $m$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$M$ is a \emph{submanifold} of $N$ if there exists an immersion from $M$ to $N$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
	$\R P^n \isom \R P^{n-1} \cup \R^n$.
	\textbf{Proof.}  In $\R^{n+1}$, draw a flat "plane" above the origin.  Each line in $\R P^n$ that has a nonzero "z" component will intersect this plane.  So each line maps to its intersection with this plane, and this plane is $R^n$.  The remaining lines are all in $\R P^{n-1}$.  Wow!
\end{thm}



If $f$ is a mersion, then we can differentiate, getting the linear map $d_x(\phi_a^{-1}.f.\psi_b): R^m \to R^n$.

\begin{thm}
	$f$ is a mersion.
	$f$ is an \emph{immersion} if forall $x$, $d_x$ above is injective.  (Note: this is *local* injectivity of f) ($m \leq n$)
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	$f$ is a mersion.
	$f$ is a \emph{submersion} if forall $x$, $d_x$ above is surjective.  (Note: this is *local* surjectivity of f) ($m \geq n$)
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	An \emph{embedding} $f$ is an immersion s.t. $f : M \to f(M)$ is a homeomorphism.  Here is an equivalent, ``minimal'' definition:  An \emph{embedding} is an immersion that is injective and proper.
\end{defn}

An immersion is locally injective.  An embedding is globally injective.

\begin{thm}
	$f$ from $M^m$ to $N^n$ is a submersion, and $f(x) = y$.  Then $f^{-1}(y)$ is a smooth $(m-n)$ dimensional manifold.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	$f$ is a mersion.
	$\phi_a(x) \in M$ is a \emph{regular} point if $d_x(\phi^{-1}.f.\psi)$ is onto.  Otherwise, $\phi_a(x)$ is a \emph{critical} point.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$f$ is a mersion.
	$y \in N$ is a \emph{regular} value if every point in $f^{-1}(y)$ is regular.  Otherwise, $y$ is a \emph{critical} value.  Note: values $y$ *not* in the image of $f$ are vacuously regular.

\begin{thm}
	This comes from the Local Submersion Theorem.  If $y \in N$ is a regular value, then $f^{-1}(y)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$ of dimension $m-n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{example}
	$M_n(\R)$ vectors of dim $n^2$.  $S_n(\R)$ the symmetric matrices.  Note that the matrix $A^T A$ is always symmetric.  $O(n)$ group ortho matrices.

	Let $f$ from $M_n(\R)$ to $S_n(\R)$ given by $f(A) = A^T A$.

	THEN $I_n$ in $S_n(\R)$ is a regular value.  Here's why...

	Corr. $O(n) = f^{-1}(I_n)$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $n^2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ = $\binom n2$.

	and

	$O(n) = SO(n)$ disjoiunt union $SO(n)Diagmatrix(-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)$

	proof of claim

	Given $A$ in $M_n$, find a formula $df_A$ from $M_n$ to $S_n$ ...

	$df_A(B) = \lim \frac{f(A+tB) - f(A)}{t} = \ldots = B^T A + A^T B$
	is indeed in $S_n$! (it is symmetric)

	If $A^T A = I_n$, can every symmetric matric $C$ be written in the form $C = B^T A + A^T B$.

	sneaky trick
	Guess $A^T B = \frac12 C$.
	This is possible if we let $B = \frac12 AC$.
	Then it works!
