# Grad School Notes

While attending the Mathematics PhD program at the University of Virginia, a few of us decided to collaborate on our class notes in LaTeX. These notes are still always open to change. Many of them are tracked on GitHub, which means every change is reversible and trackable. For the following courses, compiled PDFs are available [here](https://github.com/ghseeli/grad-school-notes/releases/latest) and are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/ghseeli/grad-school-notes)

1. Algebra 1 and 2 transcribed by Richard Vradenburgh
1. Algebraic Topology 1 written by Matthew Lancellotti and Chris Lloyd
1. Complex Analysis written by George H. Seelinger
1. Differential Topology written by Matthew Lancellotti
1. Real Analysis written by George H. Seelinger and Matthew Lancellotti

Other notes maintained for second year courses will become available soon pending contributors!
