# Grad School Notes

This repository is intended to contain working LaTeX drafts of my notes from my
classes in graduate school for mathematics. The motivation for this undertaking
is the following.
* Going over notes a second time helps with comprehension and memory
* Often instructors leave details to the student. Often, I forget I should do
  these. Typing up my notes will help me remember to think of these things.
* I will not lose my notes if they are typed up and on GitHub.
* Open to collaborators to help me catch mistakes and provide additional
  insight should anyone be so inclined.
