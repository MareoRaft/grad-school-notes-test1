# Grad School Notes

This repository is intended to contain working LaTeX drafts of notes from our 
classes in graduate school for mathematics. The motivation for this undertaking
is the following.
* Going over notes a second time helps with comprehension and memory
* Often instructors leave details to the student. One can forget one should do
  these. Typing up notes will help us remember to think of these things.
* We will not lose my notes if they are typed up and on GitHub.
* One source of notes will be useful for studying for qualifying exams.
* One can search typed up notes very easily.
* Notes are open to collaborators to help us catch mistakes and provide additional
  insight should anyone be so inclined.
