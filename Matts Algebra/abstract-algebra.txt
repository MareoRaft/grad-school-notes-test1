Algebra I
==============

1.1
Groups
---------

def
The __symmetric group__ Sn = (A, o) is comprised of the set A of autojections on [n] and the operation "o" of composition.
intuition
Consider the set [n] of exactly n elements.  An autojection on [n] is a bijection from [n] to [n].  This is more commonly known as a permutation.  The set of all such permutations on [n] makes up the group Sn.  So Sn is all the ways that you can reorder n elements.

def
The __quaternion group__ Q8 is the group generated by the elements -1, i, j, k under the relations
	* (-1)^2 = 1
	* i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
	* -1 commutes with all other elements.
intuition
The quaternion group, denoted Q or Q8, is (A, *) where A = {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} and * is element multiplication.  When the elements of A multiply, they must obey the following laws:
	* ij = k
	* jk = i
	* ki = j
	* ji = -k
	* kj = -i
	* ik = -j
	* (-1)^2 = 1
	* -1 commutes with all elements of A

name
homomorphism (groups) (algebra)
def
Given two groups \mathcal{A} = (A, \cdot_A) and \mathcal{B} = (B, \cdot_B), a __morphism__ h is a function from A to B such that h(s \cdot_A t) = h(s) \cdot_B h(t) for all s, t \in A.

thm
If h: A to B is a homomorphism of groups, then
	* h(0_A) = 0_B, where 0 denotes the identity
	* h(-t) = -h(t), where - denotes the inverse, and t is any element of A.

name
isomorphism (groups) (algebra)
def
Given two groups \mathcal{A} = (A, \cdot_A) and \mathcal{B} = (B, \cdot_B), an __isomorphism__ is a morphism from \mathcal{A} to \mathcal{B} that is a bijection.
synonyms
bimorphism
intuition
An isomorphism \iota satiesfies: 1. \iota : \mathcal{A}\\to\mathcal{B} is a morphism and 2. \iota is bijective.  It comes automatically that \iota^{-1} : \mathcal{B}\\to\mathcal{A} is a morphism.

def
An __automorhpism__ is a bimorphism from a group to itself.

def
Given a group G, the __group of automorhpisms__ on G is the set of all automorphisms on G, combined with the binary operation of composition.
notation
(Aut(G), o)

def "lookup and move if necessary"
The __general linear group__ GLn(R) = (A, *) is comprised of the set A of invertible n x n matrices over the ring R and the operation * of matrix multiplication.
intuition
Consider a subspace of R that has dimension n.  Then A is the set of linear transformations on the subspace, and * is the operation of composition.

def
An __inner automorphism__ of a group G is an automorphism that can be achieved by conjugation by some element g in G.

def
The __group of inner automorphisms__ of a group G is the set of inner automorphisms of G combined with the operation of composition.
notation
Inn(G)

def
A __magma__ is an ordered pair (S, *) where S is a set and * is a binary operation on S.
intuition
S is a set.  A binary operation on S is a function (like +) that combines two elements of S to create another (possibly the same) element in S.  The property of CLOSURE is automatically satisfied, by the definition of a binary operation.

def
A __semigroup__ is an associative magma.

def
A __monoid__ is a semigroup with an identity.

def
A __group__ is a monoid with inverses.

thm [minimal group properties]
A semigroup with a right (left) identity and right (left) inverses is a group.

def
Given a group {G} = (G, *), a __subgroup__ of {G} is a group {H} = (H, *) such that H ⊆ G and 1_H = 1_G.
note
Note that H uses the same binary operation as G, except that the domain is restricted to H x H.

thm [minimal subgroup properties]
If A is a nonempty ⊆ of group G, and for all s,t in A, st^{-1} in A, then A is a subgroup of G.  Note that t^{-1} denotes the inverse of t in G.

thm
If f : G to H is a group morphism, then
	(a) If A subgroup G, then f(A) subgroup H
	(b) If B subgroup H, then f'(B) subgroup G

def
A group {G} = (G, *) is __cyclic__ if it can be generated by a single element of G.
note
A cyclic group that can be generated by the element b is often denoted <b>.

thm [classification of cyclic groups]
Every cyclic group of order n (positive integer) is isomorphic to the group Z mod nZ.
note
The cyclic group of infinite order is isomorphic to Z, which is also Z mod 0Z.

thm [fundamental theorem of cyclic groups] [subgroups of cyclic groups]
Given a cyclic group <t> of order n in N*, then there is a bijection between the subgroups of <t> and the factors of n.  More specifically, for each factor y of n, the element t^{n/y} generates a subgroup of order y.  For every nonfactor y (relatively prime) to n, the element t^y generates all of <t>.

thm [characterization by subgroups] [equivalent definitions of finite cyclic]
Given that G is a group of order n < oo, the following statements are equivalent.
	1. G is cyclic.
	2. For every factor f of n, G has exactly one subgroup of order f.
	3. For every factor f of n, G has at most one subgroup of order f.

cor
If a group G is not cyclic, and |G| = n, then there exists a factor f|n s.t. there is more than one subgroup of order f.

name
normal (subgroup)
synonym
A semi-commutes in G
def
Given a group G, a subgroup N of G is __normal__ if for all g in G, gN = Ng.
intuition
Being a normal subgroup of G is like being semi-commutative in G.  You have that gN = Ng, but this does not mean that gn = ng for every n \in N.  The elements of N may get reordered when going from gN to Ng.

thm [minimal normal subgroup property]
Given a group G, if a subgroup A of G satisfies for all g in G, gAg^{-1} ⊆ A, then A is normal in G.
"didn't Abramenko warn us about something like this"

thm [matt]
G group.  H ≤ G.  a automorphism on G.  Then a(H) ≤ G.
cor
For any element g in G, gHg' ≤ G.

def
A subgroup H ≤ G is __characteristic__ in G if for every automorphism alpha of G, alpha(H) = H.
notation
H char G
examples
{e}, G, Z(G), [G, G], [G, [G, G]].  Automorphisms preserve properties, so if you define a subgroup by all elements that satisfy a property, chances are its characteristic!

thm
H characteristic in G implies H normalin G

thm
A char H char G implies A char G

thm
A char H normalin G implies A normalin G

thm
A, B char G implies [A, B] char G

def
Given a group G and a normal subgroup N, the __quotient group__, denoted G/N, is the group of left cosets of N.  The operation is inherited from G.
synonym
factor group

thm [first isomorphism theorem]
Let \phi: G to H be a morphism of groups.  Then the image \phi(G) is isomorphic to G/ker(\phi).
proof
	ker(\phi) is normal, so denote N.
	Consider a new map \phi' from G/N to \phi(G) defined by \phi'(gN) = \phi(g).
		\phi' is well-defined:
			gN = g'N
			there exists an n \in N such that g' = gn
			show that \phi(g') = \phi(g)
			show \phi' is a morhpism (use \phi(g') = \phi(g))
			show \phi' is onto
			show \phi' is one-to-one (just show that ker(\phi') = eN is just the identity)
			conclude \phi' is a bimorphism

"don't we need definition of normalizer above this?"
thm [second isomorphism theorem]
Let G be a group, let A,B be subgroups of G, and let A ≤ N(B).  Then
	1. The product AB is a subgroup of G. (prev thm)
	2. The intersection A ∩ B is a normal subgroup of A. (prev thm?)
	3. The quotient groups (AB)/B and A/(A∩ B) are isomorphic.
proof
	want proof for statement 3. apply 1.1.10 to the group hom

thm [third isomorphism theorem]
Given A, B \normalin G and A ≤ B.  Then G/B iso to (G/A) / (B/A)
proof
	let phi : G/A to G/B defined by gA maps to gB.
	Show phi is well-defined, surjective, morphism.

1.1.1
def
Given a semigroup G and a subset S, the __centralizer__ of S in G, denoted C_G(S), is the set of elements in G that commute with every element of S.

def
The __center__ of a group G, denoted Z(G), is the centralizer of G in G.

def
Given a semigroup G and a subset S, the __normalizer__ of S in G is the set of elements t in G such that tS = St.
notation
N_G(S), or N(S)

1.1.2
thm
Given a group (G, *) and a set A ⊆ G, then the centralizer of A is a subset of the normalizer of A.

thm
If B is a subgroup of G, then B normal subgrp of G iff N(B) = G.

thm
B is always a normal subgroup of the normalizer of B.

def
Let A be a subgroup of G.  A is __central__ in G if A is in the center of G.

1.1.5
thm
If H is a subgroup of G, H is central in G, and G/H is cyclic, then G is abelian.
proof
	G/H is cyclic, so there exists g in G such that G/H = <gH>.  Define n := |G/H|.  G is cyclic and elements of G look like gH so there exists some gH in G/H with order n so eH = (gH)^n = gHgH...gH = g^nH^n = g^nH so everything in G/H is some power of g times H.  You basically show that every element in G/H can be written in the form g^t*h for some t power and some h in H.  Also, we see that g^n = e.  Then we have commuting g^t*h_1 * g^s*h_2 = g^s*h_2 * g^t*h_1.
counterexample
	We will show that this is not necessarily true when G/H is abelian but not cyclic.  Let Q be the quaternion group.  Then Z(Q) = {+-1} is central in Q, and Q/Z(Q) isom Z2 x Z2 is abelian.  But Q is not abelian!

1.1.6
thm
If G is a group and A,B ≤ G, then
	(a) A ≤ N(B) or B ≤ N(A) implies AB = BA
	(b) AB = BA iff AB ≤ G

thm [Matt]
If A is normal in B (loosely), then A normalin AB (grouply).

1.1.7
thm
Given A,B ≤ G.  If |A|,|B| < oo, then |AB| = \frac{|A||B|}{|A ∩ B|}
proof
	A/(A∩ B) has left cosets A'={a_1,,,a_n} so that A = \disjoint union a_i(A∩ B) and has |A|/|A ∩ B| elements.
	Let f : A' x B \to AB be f(a_i, b) = a_ib
	f is injective proof:
		if a_ib = a_jb', then
		a_j^{-1}a_i = b'b^{-1} element of A ∩ B
		a_j^{-1}a_i element of A ∩ B
		We know that a_i(A ∩ B) = a_j(A ∩ B) implies i=j
		i = j
		a_ib = a_ib'
		b=b'
	f is surjective
	f is bijective
notation
	cycles go left to right.  (1234) means 1 maps to 2, and so forth.
	But a cycle is considered a function, so cycle composition is read right to left.  (123)(43) means apply (43) and then apply (123).

	b. [A : A ∩ B] ≤ [G:B]
	c. [G : A ∩ B] ≤ [G:A][G:B]
proof
	b. define f(a(A ∩ B)) = aB coset!
	f is well defined (erm i think that means injective? unambiguous?) a(A ∩ B) = a'(A ∩ B) implies aB = a'B
	f is injective
note
This is true even when A and/or B are infinite!

properties of eulers phi (totient) function:

explicit formula! (see mathworld for more on below)
3. phi(n) = n MULT (1 - 1/p) over every prime p that divides n
pf
	Let p1,,,pk be the unique prime divisors of n.
	To count the # of numbers relatively prime to n, start with n and subtract off # multiples of p1, and # multiples of p2, etc.  But then you overcounted, so add on # multiples of p1p2, and all other pairs.  But then you overcounted, so subtract off triples, etc.  Factor out n.  Factor the result, and you obtain the formula.

		proof: Show | Z_ab | = ab = | Z_a || Z_b | = | Z_a times Z_b | by showing that ker(f) = 1, or something.

consequence
Since n = p_1^{e^1}...p_r^{e^r} for p's distinct primes, then we conclude
Z_n bimorphic to \prod_{i=1}^{r} Z_{p_i^{e_i}} (direct prod of rings)

	Suppose FSOC that A is infinite.  Then take a cycle <g> in A.  Then <2g> is a polite subgroup.  (Contradiction).
	A is finite, and by prop 1.2.7, we must require that |A| is prime in order to have only impolite subgroups!

Z_p = F_p commutative ring which turns out to be a field :)
An elementary abelian p-group is an F_p vector-space

(think of it this way...)
A is an elementary abelian p-group.
Then A is a Z_p module
Then A is a F_p vector space.

note that any group morphism f : A to A is automatically F_p-linear:

cor
	a. A is direct sum of $n$ copies of Z_p.
	b. Aut(A) = GL_n(A) = { f: A to A } f is bij and F_p-linear.

Nilpotent and solvable groups
--------------------------------

1.3.1
def
	Here is my guess at why this is called the lower "central" series:  Look at the series backwards, where G[i] is the identity.  G[i-1] is central in G.  G[i-1] mod G[i] is central in G mod G[i].  G[i-k] mod G[i-k+1] is central in G mod G[i-k+1].  This should be verified!

	a. The __lower (or descending) central series__ of G is defined inductively by G[0] = G
	G[1] = [G, G]
	G[i] = [G, G[i-1]]

	G is __nilpotent__ if there exists i s.t. G[i] = 1
	G is nilpotent of __class__ i if G[i] = 1 but G[i-1] != 1

	b. The __derived (or commutator) series__ of G is defined inductively by
	G(1) = [G, G]
	G(i) = [G(i-1), G(i-1)]

	G is __solvable__ if there exists i s.t. G(i) = 1

thm
G solvable <==> G has a subnormal series where every quotient is abelian

G finite solvable <==> G has a composition series where every quotient is a cyclic group of prime order
pf
	If G finite solvable, then G has a subnormal series where every quotient is abelian.  For each quotient that is NOT simple, the series can be REFINED by finding a normal group in the quotient, and hence by the correspondence theorem, a normal group between the two guys in the series.  Since G is FINITE, the refinement can't go on forever, and we are left with SIMPLE abelian quotients (hence a composition series).  Every simple abelian group is a cyclic group of prime order, so every quotient is as desired.  The opposite direction is easy.

	Let A subgrp B.  By induction.  Let Ak subgrp of Bk in the lower central series (I.H.).  Then [A, Ak] subgrp [B, Bk].  So the A lower central series is always "contained" in the B lower central series.  If B is nilpotent, then there exists n s.t. Bn = 1.  Then An = 1 too.  So A is nilpotent.

	Then bar(g) = gZ(B)
	for each a in A, bar(a) = aZ(B)

Group Actions
----------------

1.5.1
def
X is a set.  G __acts__ on X from the left if there is a map
G x X \to X
(g,x) to g.x

1.5.3
def
To generalize "action" above further, if X has an additional structure (group, ring, field, etc), then we require that each g(X) preserves the structure in order for it to be called an action.
Otherwise stated, we require that pi_g in Aut(X).

In particular, note that if X is a V.S., then pi_g in Aut(X) = GL(X) is called a __linear representation__.
(because each element of Aut(X) is *represented* by a *linear* function (each invertible matrix is linear))

1.5.5
def
G acts on X.  The __stabilizer__ of x in X is the set of all elements in g that fix x.
denotation: Stab_G(x), Stab(x), G_x,
note: Stab(x) is a subgroup of G.
We also define the Stab(Y) for any ⊆ Y of X.  (g.Y = Y)
We also define the __fixer__ of Y, Fix_G(Y), Fix(Y) so that every element of Y is fixed.

1.5.6
A __free__ action is an action where for all x in X, Stab(X) = {e}.

examples
	e. If X is G/H (The set of cosets), then the Stab(gH) is gHg^{-1}.
	f. G acts on itself by conjugation.  Then for any H ≤ G, the Stab(H) is the N_G(H).
	   And the Fix(H) is the C_G(H) (centralizer of H)

1.5.7
rmk
Stab(g.x) = g Stab(x) g^{-1}

phi : G \to S(X) by
phi(g) = pi_g is called the "associated group hom"
In which case, G acts *faithfully* iff Fix(G) = intersection across all x of Stab(x) = {e}

1.5.8
Corollary [Cayley's Theorem]
If |G| = n, then G isomorphic to a subgroup of Sn.

1.5.9
prop
If H ≤ G and [G : H] < oo, then there exists a group hom \phi : G \to Sn with
Stab(1) = H and ker \phi = intersection across all g in G of gHg^{-1}

prop

G.x is the orbit of x.

X is partitioned into its orbits.  The partition is denoted X/G.

Let's consider

|G| = sum |G.x|

If G acts on X by conjugation then G.x is the conjugacy class of x, and G_x is all elements that commute with x, a.k.a. C(x).

So

|G| = |Z(G)| + sum |G.x|

for the x's on the right *not* in Z(G), and therefore these G.x's have size greater than 1.

|G| = |Z(G)| + sum [G : C(x)]

		G is nilpotent, so H is nilpotent, and if U exists, U is nilpotent.
		Look at G/H.  Find a subgrp of order p.  Go back to G.  It's U!
		But how to find that subgrp?
		Remember that in the lower central series, [G,G] is the commutator sbgrp.
		So G/[G,G] is the abelianizer of G, so G/[G,G] is abelian.
		Also, p | |G/[G,G]|, so there exists a subgrp of G/[G,G] of order p. (previous theorem (there exists el of order p))
		If H contains [G,G], just use the above trick with H instead of [G,G].
		Otherwise, there exists some aba'b' not in H.










1.5.22
If |G| = p^2 for p prime, then G is abelian.  (And G iso Zp x Zp, or Zp^2 by Fund Thm Finite Abelian Grps)

	Assume not.  Then Z(G) is a strict subgroup of G.  Previous theorem gives that Z(G) is also nontrivial.  So Z(G) is proper.  So |Z(G)| = p.  |G/Z(G)| = p, so G/Z(G) is cyclic.  Z(G) is abelian and G/Z(G) is cyclic, so G is abelian.

	e. A to A \rtimes B by f(a) = (a,e) is an inmorphism.  Check this!  Do the same for B to A \rtimes B, f(b) = (e,b).

	These subgroups A, B ≤ G habe the following props:

	(a) The Sylow p-subgroups are conjugates of each other
	(b) n_p = |Syl_p(G)| = [ G : N(P) ].  And so n_p divides m.
	(c) n_p = 1 mod p

pf
	(pictures in camera)
	(b) and (c)
	Cool proof that n_p divides m.  Let P = Pp.
	By induction on |P|:
	Base case:
	|P| = 1.  By (a), every Sylow p-subgroup is trivial.  Then n_p = 1, which divides m, and equiv 1 mod p.
	Ind step:
	|P| > 1.  A nontrivial p-group has a nontrivial center.  The other p-groups are of the form gPg^{-1}, which is an isomorphism, so they have the center gZ(P)g^{-1} each (I believe this proof is wrong.  originally i thought all the P groups would have the same center Z(P).  However, I assumed that Z(P) ⊆ Z(G), which is not necessarily true).  Z(P) is contained and normal in each Sylow p-subgroup, and in G.  Now mod all of those things out by Z(P).  The P' are the Sylow p-subgroups of G', and since z = |Z(P)| > 1, their orders are LESS.  By the inductive hypothesis, n_p' divides (|G|/p^e)/z and n_p' equiv 1 mod p.  But n_p' = n_p, so n_p divides |G|/p^e and n_p equiv 1 mod p.

Free groups and presentations
--------------------------------

1.8.1
Construction of free groups

Let X be the set of possible elements.
Let Y = X union X', where ' means inverse
Let W(X) be the set of "words" on Y (yes, Y)
def
w,v are __elementary equivalent__ if
	i) w = w1w2 and v = w1yy'w2 for some y in Y, or vice-versa (switching w and v)
def
w,v are __equivalent__ if w=v or there exists a finite sequence of elementary equivalences that convert w to v.

def
F(X) := (W(X)/~, cat) is called the __free group__ on X (or "with basis X").

--

There is an obvious map iota:
iota : X to F(X)
x mapsto [x]

1.8.2
prop [Universal Prop of F(X)]
For any group G and any map f : X to G, there exists a unique group morphism phi : F(X) to G s.t. iota.phi = f.  (this is the diagram *)

1.8.3
rmk
	a) iota is injective
	b) <X> (nerrrrrmm) = F(X)
	c) F(X) is characterized (up to isomorphism) by its universal property.
	d) If X, X' are sets with |X| = |X'|, then F(X) isom F(X').
		pf
		|X| = |X'| means there is a bijection b : X to X'.
		Then for each t in F(X), send t to representation from x els, then map with b, then finally to F(X').
		Show this is an isomorphism.

1.8.4
cor
Every group is (isomorphic to) a quotient of a free group.

1.8.5
def
An element of W(X) is __reduced__ if w has no subwords of the form yy'.
Wo(X) is the set of reduced words.

thm
every word corresponds (by deletion of yy' stuff) to a unique reduced word.

psi : Wo(X) to F(X)
psi(w) = [w]

psi is surjective, injective.  Therefore, we may identify (via psi) the elements of F(X) with those of Wo(X).

1.8.6
def
G group.  S set.  S subseteq G.  The __normal closure__ of S in G, denoted <S>_G, is the smallest normal subgroup of G which contains S.  (By definition, it is the intersection of all normal subgroups of G that contain S).

thm
<S>_G = { g1{s1}^{e1}g1'...gn{sn}^{en}gn' | n in N, g in G, s in S, e in {+-1}}

// How I think about free groups
// X --> W(X) --> C(X) --> F(X)
// W(X) is words on X.  These are finite sequences on X.
// C(X) is equivalence classes of words.  The equiv rel is defined inductively using (y,y') = (), etc.
// F(X) is C(X) together with the concatenation operation.

// X ----> F(X)
//   -      v
//    f-->  G

// Think of G as generated by X and with relations imposed by f.  The there is a homomorphism from F(X) to G by collapsing by the relations.

// thm [Awesome, on midterm]
// Every group of order n is cyclic iff (n, phi(n)) = 1.

1.8.7
def
A __presentation__ <X|R> of a group consists of a map f : X to G (which is often an embedding) and a subset of relations R ⊆ F(X) s.t.
	a) <f(X)> = G
	b) <R>_{F(X)} = ker phi (in the diagram *) (note that <R> is ALL of the relations, whereas R is more like the "relation generators".  It is convenient if R is minimal.)
	notation) <X|R> isom G

1.8.8
rmk
	a) Usually one thinks of X as embedded in G and often doesn't distinguish (if f is injective) between x and f(x).
	If one starts with relations, you must check to see if such relations create identities between the elements of X.
	b) Technically, a "relation" is an element of R, and hence of F(X).  (each el is equiv to the identity)
	c) Given any X and any R ⊆ F(X), there is always a group w/ presentation <X|R>, namely:
		G := F(X)/<R>_{F(X)}

If G is given with generating set X, in order to decide whether G has the presentation <X|R> for some R ⊆ F(X), one must do the following: (let G~ = <X|R>)

X ⊆ G, f iota G
X inclusion F(X)
F(X) phi G

	i) check whether for any reduced word w with [w] in R, the equation w = e holds in G.
	ii) If true, there exists a surjective homomorphism phi~: G~ onto G.

	F(X) phi G
	F(X) p onto G~
	G~ phi~ G

	ker p = <R> ⊆ ker phi normal sbgrp F(X)
	phi~(g~) = phi(g) for any g in F(X) with p(g) = g~ (well-defined.)

	iii) Verify (often difficult!) that phi~ is injective.  (For finite groups, try |G~| ≤ |G|) (For infinite groups, try using 'normal forms' for the elements in G)

1.8.9
example
	(a) G = < a,b | a^2=b^2, a^3=b^3 >
	therefore, b=a
	So G = < a | e > = <a> isom Z

	(b) Presentation for S3 = <(12), (23)>?

	G~ = < a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1; (ab)^3 = 1 > (so aba = bab)
	G' := {e, a, b, ab, ba, aba=bab}

	claim: G' = G

	observe aG' ⊆ G' and bG' ⊆ G'

	G~ ≤ <a,b> (note that <a,b> denoted the subgroup of G~ generated by a and b, NOT a free group)
	==> <a,b>.G' ⊆ G' ==> G~G' ⊆ G' ==> G~ ⊆ G', so G~ = G'

	therefore, |G~| = |G'| ≤ |S3|

	Have a surj hom phi~ : G~ to S3
 	                       a mapsto (12)
	                       b mapsto (23)

	|G~| ≤ 6 = |S3|
	|G~| = 6, phi~ is bijective
	G~ isom S3, S3 has presentation < a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1; (ab)^3 = 1 > (so aba = bab)

	(c) Q isom < a,b | a^4 = 1, a^2=b^2, aba'=b' >
		so b^4 = 1

	(d) Zm x Zn = < a,b | a^m=b^n=1, ab=ba > = { a^ib^i | 0 ≤ i ≤ m-1, 0 ≤ j ≤ n-1 }

	(e) D2n = < a,b | a^n=b^2=1, bab' = a' >

	(f) Doo = < a,b | b^2 = 1, bab' = a' >

		isom < s,c | s^2=c^2=1 > isom Z2 * Z2  (* is the free product)

		(by sending a mapto sc and ba mapsto c)

	(g) Z2 isom < a,b | ab=ba >

1.8.10
prop [This is like a more general/practical version of the Univ. Prop of Free Groups]
Let G be a group with presentation <X|R> s.t. X embeds into G ( X ⊆ G generates G ) (we write "X embeds into G" for convenience, because it means that X injects into G (no redundancies.  Here is an example without "embeds": <a,b | a^2=b^2, a^3=b^3 >.  Here, a=b, which is annoying.  So "embeds" gives us injectivity so we don't have to deal with the annoyingness.  But the proposition could still be formulated without it.).  If H is another group, then the function f : X to H extends (uniquely) to a morphism psi^ : G to H iff
		(*) for all ei in {+-1}, for all [x1^e1...xn^en] in R, f(x1)^e1...f(xn)^en = e in H

1.8.11
examples
	(a) G = Zm x Zn = < a,b | a^m=b^n=aba'b'=1 >, X = {a,b}.

	We want to define a morphism phi : G to G by setting phi(a) = a^ib^j, psi(b) = a^kb^l

	f : X to G
	    a mapsto a^ib^i
	    b mapsto a^kb^l

	When can f be extended to a morphism?
	G is abelian, so f(a)f(b) = f(b)f(a) is automatically satisfied.
	Needed : f(a)^m = 1 iff a^mib^mj = 1 iff n|mj iff n/(n,m) | j
	similarly, f(b)^n = 1 iff m/(n,m) | i

	special case: m|n, n = md with d in N(atural numbers)

2.1.5
prop [equivalent to Zorn's Lemma!]
If I is a strict ideal in R, then there exists a maximal ideal M in R with I ⊆ M.
pf
	Let S = { J proper ideal in R | I ⊆ J } nontrivial since I in S.
	S is partially ordered by containment.
	We check that every chain in S has an upper bound.
	If (Ja) is a chain in S, that is, for all a,b in A, Ja ⊆ Jb or vice versa.
	we must verify it has an upper bound

	Take J := union_a Ja
	verify:
		1. I ⊆ J
		2. J ideal in R:
			x,y in J and r in R implies there exists a,b in A s.t. x in Ja and y in Jb
		i) this implies x+y in J_max{a,b} ⊆ J
		ii) r in R and x in Ja implies ra in Ja ⊆ J.
	J is an upper bound of the chain by construction, and we quickly verify that J in S (We verify J is strictly contained in R: Every Ja < R.  For all Ja, 1 not in Ja.  1 not in union_a Ja.  1 not in J.  J < R.)
	By Zorn's lemma, S has a maximal element M.

	Then I ⊆ M, and M is a maximal ideal of R.

Rings of Fractions
-------------------

ex
Z include into Q

thm
If D is an integral domain, then D can be embedded (as a subring) into some field F.

(see D.F. section 7.5 for summary)
(see D.F. 15.4 for much more detailed/abstract stuff)

2.2.1
def
D ⊆ R is __multiplicatively closed__ if
	1. there is mult closure AND
	2. e in D.

examples
	1. R integral domain, D = R\{0}
	2. D = R \ P for any prime ideal P
	3. x in R and D = <x>

We will build a concept of element inversion for both 1. integral domains and 2. for any D = R \ P for any P prime.  This is called "localization".

' = inverse
let's invert D in some bigger ring D'R.
Start with R x D and define ~ equiv rel. as follows:
	(r,d) ~ (r',d')
	iff
	rd' = r'd
	iff
	rd' - r'd = 0

	but transitivity is not possible without integral domains...
	so modify relation to

	there exists some t in D s.t.
	t(rd' - r'd) = 0

	this definition will be equivalent to the above in integral domains.  But outside of integral domains, it works too!

notation
for some r in R and d in D, then
r/d
denotes the equiv class [(r,d)]

D'R := { r/d | r in R, d in D }

We want to introduce + and * operations as follows:
r/d + s/e = (re + sd)/de and r/d * s/e = rs/de

We need to verify both operations are well-defined!

The result is that D'R is a commutative ring with 1, and every d in D has an inverse element 1/d.

Wahoo!

rmk
0 in D <==> D'R = {0}
so we typically omit 0 from D.
if n nilpotent and n in D ==> D'R = {0}
so we typically omit nilpotent elements from D.

Wahoowah!

(The zero ring {0} *does* have a multiplicative identity, and it is 0)




2.2.2
prop
	(a) For any mult closed D ⊆ R, D'R is a comm ring with 1 called the __ring of fractions__ of R w.r.t D.
	(b) D'R = {0} <==> 0 in D
	(c) The canonical map j : R to D'R (by r mapsto r/1) satisfies j(D) ⊆ (D'R, *)
	(d) If R an integral domain and 0 not in D, then j is injective.
	(e) If R an integral domain and D = R \ {0}, then D'R is a field containing j(R) isom R.  This is called the __field of fractions__ of R, and it is a field.
notation
Frac(R) := (R\{0})'R

2.2.3
prop (Universal prop of D'R)
Given R and D and the canonical j : R to D'R, for any comm ring S and any ring morphism phi : R to S with phi(D) ⊆ (S,*), then there exists a unique ring morphism phi~ : D'R to S s.t. j.phi~ = phi.

A commutative ring is called a __local ring__ if it has a maximUM ideal.

example
R = Z, P = (p). Then
Z_(p) = { a/b | a,b in Z, p does not divide b }
The prime ideals of Z_(p) are {0} and pZ_(p)

2.2.9(Matt)
Every localization is a local ring.
pf
	Let R_P be the localization of R at P.

	P is a proper ideal of R.  D := R\P is disjoint from P.  Therefore, by 2.2.6(a), D'P is a proper ideal of D'R.

	D'P is a *proper* ideal, so every element of D'P is not invertible.  Every element a/d in the complement D'(R\P) is invertible, since d/a in D'R.

	Therefore, D'P is the set of non-units in D'R.

	D'P is closed under addition, since p/d + p2/d2 = (d2 * p + d * p2) / (d * d2) and (d2 * p + d * p2) in P thanks to absorption and (d * d2) in D since, as was shown in this weeks homework, our particular D is multiplicatively closed.

	P has an additive identity, so P must contain 0.  P is proper, so R must contain something other than 0.  So R is nontrivial, and since 0 not in D, then D'R is nontrivial also.  D'R = R_P is nontrivial.

	By homework 11, number 1, if R_P is nontrivial, then R_P is a local ring.

	Then it's true by 2.3.9.

2.3.11
examples
	(a) R = Z6, f = -x + 2, g = 2x^2 + 3.

	(c) R = Q, f = 2x + 1, g = x^2 - 1, find the h and r.  Yay!  Observe that h and r are unique, and since they are not in Z[x], this proves why (b) is impossible.

m in Z is __square free__ if m != 0, m != 1, and the square of any prime number does not divide m.
note
A square free m is -1 or the product of distinct primes.

2.4.9
quadratic number fields.
Fix m in Z square free (see above).
Then sqrt(m) not in Q
if m < 0, sqrt(m) is imaginary.
if m > 1, m = p1...pe ==> for all nonzero integers a, ma^2 not in (unique prime factorization) Z2

So if sqrt(m) in Q, then sqrt(m) = b/q ==> a^2m = b^2, a contradiction,

consequence
for some s, t in Q, s + t*sqrt(m) = 0  ==>  t = s = 0
That is, 1,sqrt(m) is a Q-basis of K := Km := Q[sqrt(m)] = { s + t*sqrt(m) | s,t in Q }
Km is closed under + and * ==> subring of C
Define phi : K to K

	(iii) a,b in K ==> N(ab) = ab*phi(ab) = a*phi(a)*b*phi(b) = N(a)N(b)

	(1) K is a field
	(2) N : K* to Q* is a group hom.

If R subring of K satisfying N(R) ⊆ Z, then
	(a) a|b in R ==> N(a)|N(b) in Z
	(b) phi(R) ⊆ R ==> R* = { a in R | N(a) = +-1 }
	(c) If for all k in K, there exists r in R s.t. |N(k-r)| < 1, then R is a E.D. with d(a) := |N(a)|.
		intuition:
			K is already a E.D. with degree function |N|.  Because R is really "close" to K with |N(k-r)| < 1, then we get that |N| works as a degree function for R too.

O(m) = Z[w_m] = { a + b w_m | a,b in Z }

Let u be a "universal side divisors" u in R \ R*
def
for all x in R, there exists y in (R* U {0}) s.t. u |x-y
iff
there exists q s.t. qu = x - y

Assume R is a E.D., not a field

claim
R must contain a universal side divisor.

pf
d: R\{0} to N
R \ (R* U {0}) != {}

pick u in above with d(u) minimal

For all x in R, there exist q, r in R with r=0 or d(r) < d(u) and x = qu + r
==> r in R \ (R* U {0})
==> u is a universal side divisor

example
R = O(-19) = { (k + l*sqrt(-19))/2 | k,l in Z; k = l mod 2 } = Z[(1 + sqrt(-19))/2]

R* = { +-1 }.  a in R* iff N(a) = +-1

Since R is not integrally closed, it cannot be a PID

If R is noetherian ring

N(a+b*sqrt(-5)) = a^2 + 5b^2
The units are +-1
6 = 2*3 = (1+sqrt(-5))(1-sqrt(-5)) = N(1+sqrt(-5))
If r in +-{ 2, 3, 1+sqrt(-5), 1-sqrt(-5) }, then r is irreducible, but not prime.
For example, 2 is not prime because 2|(1+sqrt(-5))(1-sqrt(-5)), but 2 does not divide (1+sqrt(-5)) nor (1-sqrt(-5)).

I used single arrow to denote that all single arrow requirements need to be satisfied.

2.5.16

R = Z[sqrt(2)] is ED, so it's a UFD
7 = (3 + sqrt(2))(3 - sqrt(2)) = (-5 + 4sqrt(2))(5 + 4sqrt(2))
It LOOKS like not UFD, but it is.  (5 + 4sqrt(2)) and (3 + sqrt(2)) are associates!

fact
If R = O(m) or Z(sqrt(m)) for m square-free, and if a in R satisfied N(a) = p, where p is a prime of Z, then a is prime.  (But we only proved a is irreducible in class)

2.5.17
In a UFD, every irreducible is prime.

Or better yet, TFAE:
	* R is a UFD
	* Every b in R' factors into irreducibles, and all irreducibles are prime
	* Every b in R' factors uniquely (up to order and units) into a product of irreducibles.

2.5.18
R UFD.  Let (C_i)_{i in I} be the family of classes of associate elements which are primes.
Choose a unique representative p_i for each C_i.
Then for each b in R', there is a unique factorization of the form

	b = u * prod_i {p_i}^{e_i}
